STATUS
======

We apply for the badges **reusable**, **available**, and **replicated**. We
believe that this badge is justified for the following reasons:

  * Public availability of the whole project on GitHub
  * GPLv2 open source license
  * A prepared docker container with automised scripts for straight-forward reproducability
  * The possibility to recreate the docker container from scratch

Replication requires two author-supplied artefacts, our code base together with
the manually created ground truth. The third ingredient, the mailing list
archive, can either be obtained from our artefact collection, or from publicly
available sources, for instance the [Linux kernel mailing lists][1].

This means our contribution is functional and available, well-structured and
well-documented. The main results of the paper can independently be obtained by
running our analysis scripts based on the aforementioned external datasets or
by using the author supplied artefact collection.
